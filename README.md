#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... everything!

In particular, I am learning Three.js, Next.js, and Rust. I've also been casually reading about biology, and, more specifically, bioinformatics. I started going through coding challenges on [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/), and writing my solutions in Rust.

I've also been working in serverless environments, and with AWS Lambda functions in particular. 

I also started working on a blog site as a subdomain for my primary website at blog.lostcoding.com. Like most of my projects, though, I've let this one go by the wayside for a bit... Ha! I'm hoping to get back into this one soon and spend some more time putting it together.
